Start pages

## Introductory text and eligibility

Tell the user:

what the service lets you do
who can use it

Keep the call to action clear.

Bear in mind that a lot of people won’t read most of the text on a start page, so design the service with that in mind.

Give just enough information to let most users assess whether or not the service will let them do the thing they want to do. Ideally, the name of the service alone would be enough. But you usually need a sentence or two of introductory text as well. Think about SEO when writing the introductory text.

You don’t have to give full eligibility criteria if it’s going to overcomplicate things for the majority of people. It may be better to ‘fail’ edge cases inside the service (especially if you can do so without adding extra questions).

If you still feel like you need to add lots of the detail to the page, there might be a problem with the scope of your service. Can you make it more intuitive by making it serve more edge cases, even if (for example) you have to route some of them to a legacy transaction?

## Telling users what they need

Tell the user about any information or documents they will need in order to use the service.

Provide any information that’s likely to be important when they’re deciding whether to use the service (eg how much it costs).

There’s no need to mention something that most users will know without looking it up (eg their home address).
